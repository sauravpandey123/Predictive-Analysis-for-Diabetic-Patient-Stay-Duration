## Introduction

Predicting the length of a patient's stay can help hospitals manage resources more effectively. This R-based approach uses multiple regression techniques to achieve accurate predictions based on a patient's attributes.

## Dataset

Three of the key attributes are:

- **Age**: Patient's age.
- **Gender**: Patient's gender.
- **Primary Diagnosis**: The primary medical condition diagnosed for the patient.

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Checking for missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.

## Installation

1. **Install R**: Follow the [official guide](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) to install R for your operating system.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: You'll need to install the `tidyverse` library, which contains essential tools for data manipulation and visualization. Install it using the command:
   ```R
   install.packages("tidyverse")
